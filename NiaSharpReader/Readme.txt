GenericHid:

http://www.lvr.com/hidpage.htm

ZedGraph:

The form code itself has been reduced to it's strict minimum as far as interactions
with the generic hidlibrary goes, and the way the data is interpreted and charted comes
from the hacked niawiimote app & excel files at http://www.neuroupdate.com/nia/


All in all the output seems pretty much ok, even if the app itself still has some bugs.


The code "should" work on win98/ME/XP/Vista, including 32bit & 64bit versions
..as long as you have the .NET 2.0 framework installed


If you want to mess with the source-code and don't have Visual Studio 2008, you can grab
the free "Visual C# 2008 Express Edition" here: http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/
